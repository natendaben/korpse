This project is a collaborative group project for the Creative Web Development Tools class at the University of Colorado Boulder. We are collectively constructing a creative narrative, where each team member contributes one paragraph based on what the previous members have contributed. The design of the webpage is also a collaborative effort.

*Team members: Jen Mah, Nate Bennett, Phil Garcia, Megan Akiba*
