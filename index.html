  <!-- Nate Paragraph 1 -->
  <p>
    Ben, the mild-mannered math teacher, left Pueblo Middle School and hopped in his Toyota Corolla. It was another Tuesday. Up above, the grim, brooding clouds threatened to rain. As Ben drove home to his surburban townhome, he put on some smooth jazz to wash away the ghosts of basic algebra.

  <!-- Jen Paragraph 1 -->
  <p>
    Ben had been quite lonely this past year. His longest conversation had been with his favorite house plant. Ben happen to be passing the local Pueblo animal shelter and spontaneously decided to stop in to check out the animals. Ben was suddenly struck with a rush of excitement.

  <p>
    Right there as soon as he entered the pet shop he saw it: there was an alligator. Ben could finally realize his dream of being the Alligator man of his local neighborhood. He asked the shop owner how much he should pay; the old decrepit clerk wheezed, "not much, only your soul." Thoroughly weirded out, Ben left the store to go get some fro-yo.

  <!-- Megan Paragraph 1 -->
  <p>
    Worried and confused, Ben drove to his favorite fro-yo shop. The smooth jazz was killing his vibe, so he changed the music to his favorite math rock album. Grow by Chon. Although the crazy time signatures were pumping him up, he was still pretty upset about not being able to take home a companion... then in an instant, a black bear appeared in front of his car.

  <section class= "parallax" id="parallax5"></section>

  <!-- Nate Paragraph 2 -->
  <p>
    Ben didn't know how the bear had caught him by surprise, but it was a great lumbering beast, and he barely had time to slam on the brakes before hitting it. The bear, angered by its near death, climbed up on top of Ben's little sedan and started jumping violently up and down. As the metal frame of his car began to shake and crunch, Ben began to panic. But then â€” a flash of green from the window, and the bear flew off of Ben's roof! Ben looked outside the window at his savior, who was still fighting the problematic bear, and felt a rush of emotion: the alligator from the pet store had tackled the bear and saved the day.

  <section class= "parallax" id="parallax6"></section>

  <!-- Jen Paragraph 2 -->
  <p>
    Ben was so thankful that his alligator ally was here to protect him from the mighty bear. He decided to take the alligator home. After loading the alligator up into his damaged Toyota Corolla, Ben made it home safely. He was shocked when he arrived home and his whole extended family surprised him with a birthday party. A shrill scream informed Ben that the alligator had already escaped from the car and was making his way into the crowded party room.   
  </p>
  <section class= "parallax" id="parallax7"></section>

  <!-- Phil Paragraph 2 -->
  <p>
    Poor naive Ben did not realize he had just brought home a literal party animal. These creatures were known to party non-stop, often drinking houses dry and leaving a trail of empty natty ice cans and juul pods. He followed the shrill scream to discover the alligator was trying to get his infantile daughter addicted to vaping. Ben burst into the room in a fury, and as the primal strength of his ancestors coursed through his veins, he quickly ran up to the alligator and with a roar... Ben called 911.
  </p>
  <section class= "parallax" id="parallax8"></section>

    <!-- Megan Paragraph 2 -->
 <p>
   It wasn't long until Ben was speaking to an operator... "911, what's your emergency?" the stern woman asked on the other end of the line. "My pet alligator... lets call him Chuck, is trying to teach my infant child how to vape..." Ben exclaimed, "This is unacceptable and I need some officers to come get Chuck and teach him a lesson or two..." The operator was instantly not amused by what she thought was a prank call and soon hung up the phone. Ben was in shock and didn't know what to do. How had he encountered such strange things in such a short period of time? In such chaos and commotion, Ben suddenly blacked out. He woke up several hours later in his bed and was relieved to realize the whole thing was a dream... until he looked over. Chuck the Alligator was passed out in the bed next to him.
